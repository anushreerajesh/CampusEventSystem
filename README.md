# Campus Event Management System

This is a small Flask + SQLite project I built for managing college events.  
It allows adding colleges, students, events, and keeping track of registrations, attendance, and feedback.


## Features

- Add students and link them to colleges
- Create events (seminars, workshops, etc.)
- Register students for events
- Mark attendance for events
- Collect feedback (rating + comment)
- Reports:
  - Registrations per event
  - Student participation
  - Top active students
